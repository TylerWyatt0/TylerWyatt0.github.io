        <h5>About</h5>
        <p>
            Accelerated Masters Computer Science student at GMU. I created for the purpose of practicing
            basic web development and any projects I've been working on. I love software engineering and strive to
            build a successful a career in the field. I aspire to work in a senior development position someday, making
            products that make life better for others. Outside of school I love to exercise! I have been practicing
            Taekwondo for over 15 years now and even teach part-time. One of my passions is weightlifting as it allows
            be to strive for easily measurable personal growth. I also enjoy video games. Some of my favorite titles are
            Sekiro, Doom Eternal, and Elden Ring. I also reluctantly play some competitive shooters such as
            Counter-Strike sometimes with my friends who are way better than me.
